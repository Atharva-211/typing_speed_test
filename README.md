## Welcome to the Typing Test of Tomorrow 
You think you’re fast? Great. But are you Superhuman fast? This typing test app isn’t just a regular old speed and accuracy tester. Nope. It’s a finely-tuned digital playground designed to sharpen your fingers and make your brain break records. Here’s the breakdown of what makes this app an absolute game-changer.

## What This Is
A React-powered typing test application that doesn’t just test your speed—it challenges your brain, hones your muscle memory, and gives you the thrill of beating your own records.

## Why You’ll Love It
If you like smooth interfaces, real-time feedback, and performance-focused design, you're in for a treat. Plus, the app has personality. You’re going to feel every word you type, from the satisfying green glow of a correctly typed word to the sharp red line-through on mistakes. Motivation meets mastery, my friend.

## How It Works
Choose Your Difficulty: Select from different word lists and quotes based on how confident (or ambitious) you’re feeling.
Pick a Time Challenge: Go for a 30 or 60-second sprint. No need for extended marathons here—we’re aiming for speed and precision, not endurance.
Type with Precision: Every word is instantly validated. Green for go, red for rethink. Because you deserve real-time performance feedback.
See Your Results: At the end of the challenge, see your stats—WPM, accuracy, and more. Bragging rights included.
